A single .sql file containing your:

CREATE TABLE statements

Sample  data





 Question 2: Create a Simple CRUD API Using MySQL + Programming

What to do:

Choose any use case (e.g., Task Manager, Contact Book, Student Portal)

Design your database schema in MySQL (at least 2–3 tables)

Build an API using:

Node.js + Express (if using JavaScript)

FastAPI (if using Python)
